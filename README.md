First is a screenshot of running pytest -v --cov for the test file containing tests for the add and subtract methods:

(note: I do have the virtual environment running as (calculator) but I did not have the screen space to include that line in the terminal in the screenshot.)


Next is a screenshot of the first successful build before adding the multiply test and method:

Thank you.
